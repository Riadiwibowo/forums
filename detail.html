            <h1>How to find the first non repeated character of given string?</h1>
            <p>The answer here is d. So the point that strikes me is that it can be done in two
                ways: for every index i loop i-1 times and check if that character occurs ever
                again. But this is not efficient: growth of this method is O(N^2)where N is the
                length of the string. Another possible good way could be if i could form a ttree
                or any other ds such that i could order the character based on the weights(the
                occurance count). This could take me just one loopof length N through the string
                to form the structure. That is just O(N)+O(time to build tree or any ds) </p>
